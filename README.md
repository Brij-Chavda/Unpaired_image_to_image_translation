Object_transfiguration task
Object transfiguration is the task of the complete change in the appearance of the object. I have worked with tiger to leaopard transfiguration task for which dataset is downloaded
from ImageNet dataset.<br />

I have given label information along with source images in generator and discriminator to generate conditional tiger to leopard and tiger to lion transfiguration task, but 
discriminator is saturating earlier which shows that this approach will not work.
